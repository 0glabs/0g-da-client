# gRPC API

This part contains the API documentation for the gRPC services included in the 0G DA platform. Each markdown file contains the protobuf definitions for each respective service including:

- [Disperser](disperser.md): the hosted service for users to interact with 0G DA.
- [Retriever](retriever.md): a service that users can run on their own infrastructure, which exposes a gRPC endpoint for retrieval and verification of blobs from 0G Storage nodes.
