# gRPC API

This part contains the API documentation for the gRPC services included in the ZeroGDA platform. Each markdown file contains the protobuf definitions for each respective service including:

* Disperser: the hosted service for users to interact with ZeroG Storage.
* Retriever: a service that users can run on their own infrastructure, which exposes a gRPC endpoint for retrieval and verification of blobs from ZeroG Storage nodes.
