# Introduction

Data availability problem stems from the demand for off-chain verification of executed states, which in turn arises from the trade-off between scalability and security of blockchain systems. The increasing prominence of Layer 2 networks and decentralized AI platforms has made the data availability even more crucial and also made its scalability the primary challenge at present.

The ZeroGDA (ZGDA) system is a scalable Data Availability (DA) service layer which is directly built on top of a decentralized storage system and addresses the scalability issue by minimizing the data transfer volume required for broadcast. Its general decentralized storage design further enables it to support a variety of availability data types from diversified scenarios not limited to Layer 2 networks but also inclusion of decentralized AI infrastructures.

&#x20;In informal terms, DA is a guarantee that a given piece of data is available to anyone who wishes to retrieve it. ZGDA is focused on providing DA with both high security and throughput.

At a high level, a DA system is one which accepts blobs of data via some interface and then makes them available to retrievers through another interface.
