# API

This part contains the API documentation for the gRPC services included in the ZeroGDA platform. Each markdown file contains the protobuf definitions for each respective service including:

* Disperser: the hosted service for users to interact with ZeroG Storage.
* Retriever: a service that users can run on their own infrastructure, which exposes a gRPC endpoint for retrieval and verification of blobs from ZeroG Storage nodes.

Please refer to [this example](https://github.com/zero-gravity-labs/zerog-da-example-rust) for how to integrate the ZGDA into your own applications.
