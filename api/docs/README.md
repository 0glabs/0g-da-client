This folder contains the API documentation for the gRPC services included in the ZGDA platform. Each markdown file contains the protobuf definitions for each respective service including:
- Disperser: the hosted service and primary point of interaction for Rollup users.
- Retriever: a service that users can run on their own infrastructure, which exposes a gRPC endpoint for retrieval of blobs from ZGDA nodes.
